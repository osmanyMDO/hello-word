A repository is the basic unit of GitHub, most commonly a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, including images â€“ anything your project needs. Because we recommend including a README, or a file describing the project, in every repository, GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. It also offers other common options such as a license file, but we can skip that for now.
